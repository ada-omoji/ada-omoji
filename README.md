### Hey, I'm Ada 👋

I'm a soon to be Junior Web Developer Graduate

🔭 I’m presently working on an online platform that connects individuals with various service providers

🌱 I'm studying Laravel and React right now.

👯 I’d like to collaborate on interesting projects where I can learn a new language

👩🏾‍💻 I currently work at <job.loading>

⚡ Fun fact: ... I can probably find the random comma that is breaking your code... but will take ages to find mine 🙃
